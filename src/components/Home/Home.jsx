              Iâ€™m particularly interested in teaching STEM and the way technology can reshape our educational experiences. In the past, Iâ€™ve worked with organizations like Girls Who Code, the Smithsonian Center for Learning and Digital Access, Girls Lead in Science and Technology, STEMclusive, and Coded by Kids to transform learning through technology, and I hope that I can continue doing so in the future :)
